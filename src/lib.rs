//! `strength_reduce` implements integer division and modulo via "arithmetic strength reduction"
//!
//! Modern processors can do multiplication and shifts much faster than division, and "arithmetic strength reduction" is an algorithm to transform divisions into multiplications and shifts.
//! Compilers already perform this optimization for divisors that are known at compile time; this library enables this optimization for divisors that are only known at runtime.
//!
//! Benchmarking shows a 5-10x speedup or integer division and modulo operations.
//!
//! # Example:
//! ```
//! use strength_reduce::StrengthReducedU64;
//! 
//! let mut my_array: Vec<u64> = (0..500).collect();
//! let divisor = 3;
//! let modulo = 14;
//!
//! // slow naive division and modulo
//! for element in &mut my_array {
//!     *element = (*element / divisor) % modulo;
//! }
//!
//! // fast strength-reduced division and modulo
//! let reduced_divisor = StrengthReducedU64::new(divisor);
//! let reduced_modulo = StrengthReducedU64::new(modulo);
//! for element in &mut my_array {
//!     *element = (*element / reduced_divisor) % reduced_modulo;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This library is intended for hot loops like the example above, where a division is repeated many times in a loop with the divisor remaining unchanged. 
//! There is a setup cost associated with creating stength-reduced division instances, so using strength-reduced division for 1-2 divisions is not worth the setup cost.
//! The break-even point differs by use-case, but is typically low: Benchmarking has shown that takes 3 to 4 repeated divisions with the same StengthReduced## instance to be worth it.
//! 
//! `strength_reduce` is `#![no_std]`
//!
//! The optimizations that this library provides are inherently dependent on architecture, compiler, and platform,
//! so test before you use.
